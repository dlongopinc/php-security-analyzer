A simple, fast, and standalone tool to find potential security vulnerabilities in PHP code.

### üìú About The Project

The **PHP Security Analyzer** is a static code analysis tool designed to help developers identify common security issues in their PHP applications, with a primary focus on **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities. It scans your code for unsanitized user inputs from superglobals (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`, etc.) and provides actionable suggestions for how to fix them.

This tool can be used as a standalone web interface for quick scans or integrated into your projects as a Composer library for automated checks.

### ‚ú® Features

  * **Core Analysis Logic**: A modular PHP class that performs static analysis on your code.
  * **Simple Web UI**: A user-friendly web interface to scan an entire directory and view a detailed report.
  * **Automated Fix Suggestions**: Provides specific code snippets to secure vulnerable lines.
  * **Flexible Detection**: Capable of tracing variables from superglobals even after they are assigned to other variables.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Warning

This tool and its web interface are **designed exclusively for local development and testing environments**.

**DO NOT** upload the `public/index.php` file or the entire analyzer directory to a live production server. Doing so could expose your server and its files to unauthorized access and security risks.

-----

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### Method 1: As a Standalone Web Interface

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dlongopinc/php-security-analyzer.git
    cd php-security-analyzer
    ```
2.  Install Composer dependencies:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```
3.  Access the web interface by navigating to `public/index.php` in your local web server.

#### Method 2: As a Composer Library

Install the package in your project using Composer:

```bash
composer require dlongopinc/php-security-analyzer
```

-----

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

#### 1\. Analyze a single file

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Dlongopinc\SecurityAnalyzer\SecurityAnalyzer;

$analyzer = new SecurityAnalyzer();
$issues = $analyzer->checkFile('path/to/your/file.php');

// $issues will be an array of found vulnerabilities.
// You can iterate through it to process the results.
if (!empty($issues)) {
    foreach ($issues as $issue) {
        echo "Found issue on line " . $issue['line'] . ": " . $issue['code'] . "\n";
        echo "Suggested fix: " . $issue['fix'] . "\n";
    }
}
```

#### 2\. Analyze all PHP files in a directory

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Dlongopinc\SecurityAnalyzer\SecurityAnalyzer;

$analyzer = new SecurityAnalyzer();
$files = $analyzer->analyzePhpFiles('path/to/your/project');
$allIssues = [];

foreach ($files as $file) {
    $issues = $analyzer->checkFile($file);
    if (!empty($issues)) {
        $allIssues[$file] = $issues;
    }
}

// $allIssues is an associative array where keys are file paths and values are issue arrays.
print_r($allIssues);
```

-----

#### 3\. Using the Web Interface

To use the web interface on your own project, copy the **`index.php`** file from the `public` directory of this package to the **root of your project**. Then, run `composer install` in your project and open `index.php` in your browser.

-----

### üîß Setting Up for Development

To ensure your development environment is clean and doesn't accidentally commit unnecessary files, make sure your `.gitignore` file includes the following entries:

  * **`vendor/`**: This directory contains all Composer dependencies and should not be committed to your repository.
  * **`composer.lock`**: This file is automatically generated by Composer. It's best practice to commit it in applications, but for a library, it's often ignored to allow consuming applications to manage their own dependency versions.

**Example `.gitignore`:**

```
/vendor
/composer.lock
```
